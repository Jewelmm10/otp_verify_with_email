# WordPress Custom Login, Registration, and OTP Verification (Astra Child Theme)

This project is a custom **Astra Child Theme** for WordPress, which customizes the default login, registration, and OTP verification pages. It provides a fully dynamic and secure user experience with custom login forms, registration forms, and OTP verification functionality. The theme ensures that your site maintains compatibility with the Astra theme while extending its functionality.

- **OTP Verification**: Added security layer with OTP (One-Time Password) verification for both login and registration processes.
- **Responsive & Mobile-Friendly**: Fully responsive design that works seamlessly across devices.
- **Astra Child Theme Compatibility**: This theme is built on the Astra Child Theme, inheriting the Astra themeâ€™s performance and flexibility.
